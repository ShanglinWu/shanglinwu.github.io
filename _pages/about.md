I'm Shanglin (Jason) Wu, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University, where I am advised by Dr. [Kai Shu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~kshu5/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm) in 2025.

My research interests center on trustworthy AI, with a particular focus on the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, I am interested in exploring the mechanisms of reasoning and knowledge grounding in LLMs, aiming to develop methods that enhance both their factual consistency and explainability. By improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, I hope to contribute to their safe and effective application across a wide range of domains.
