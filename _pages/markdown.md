## More about me
In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and guitar. Iâ€™m also passionate about coffee and film photography. I brew my own coffee and am currently learning how to roast beans. For photography, I primarily shoot with an Olympus Pen-FT and a Ricoh GR IIIx, aiming to capture candid moments on the street.

I also love outdoor adventures and road trips. If you share similar hobbies, feel free to reach out!
